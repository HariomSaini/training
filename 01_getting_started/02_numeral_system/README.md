# Numeral System

Most of us are quiet familiar with the numeral system. This program will not only help us understand the numeral system but will also introduce to us formatted I/O functions implemented by Go's fmt package. The fmt package implements functions analogous to C's printf and scanf. The format 'verbs' are derived primarily from C's but are much simpler.
